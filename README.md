# house_price_prediction
A linear regression model has been created to predict housing prices using parameters such as no of bedrooms and bathrooms, sqft and the locality
It's a House pricing predictor which utilizes linear regression to detect prices of the house using the area,square feet, no of bath room and no of bedrooms. The data was preprocessed to remove any anomaly such as outlier eg. In a particular area where 3 bhk prices are less than 2 bhk and also to remove anomalies such as bathroom being much more than the bedrooms. This particular project was also deployed on a local server.
